Hello! I'm a third-year PhD student in Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I'm advised by Professor 
[Dong Wang](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/dong-wang). Previously, I earned my master’s degree in Cognitive Science at Seoul National University, where I was advised by Professor [Gahgene Gweon](https://convergence.snu.ac.kr/en/snu__professor/gweon_gahgene/), and my bachelor’s degree in Psychology at Yonsei University. 


I investigate how AI systems reshape human cognition—specifically, how people adapt their attention, reasoning strategies, and metacognitive processes in response to AI involvement. My research examines the dynamics of this adaptation across three modes of human–AI interaction: (1) AI-to-Human (AI → Human): passive exposure to AI-generated outputs; (2) Human-to-AI (Human → AI): instructive interactions in which people teach, correct, or explain to AI systems; and (3) Human–AI Collaboration (Human ↔ AI): joint reasoning and decision-making with AI partners.


By comparing these interaction modes, I aim to uncover how different forms of engagement with AI elicit distinct cognitive responses—and what this means for designing systems that support human judgment and learning.
